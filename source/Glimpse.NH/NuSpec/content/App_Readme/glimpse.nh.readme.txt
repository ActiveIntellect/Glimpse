Glimpse.NH adds one Glimpse plugin: SQL!

The SQL tab shows every SQL statement ran by NH against your database, along with SQL connection, timings, records effected, and parameters.

To get started using Glimpse.NH you simply need to add a reference to the Glimpse.Nh.dll and Glimpse.Core.dll to your project. There is no need to change your Nh code at all!

See glimpse.readme.txt or http://getglimpse.com for more info
