Glimpse.Ado adds one Glimpse plugin: SQL!

The SQL tab shows every SQL statements ran against your database, along with SQL connection, timings, records effected, and parameters.

To get started using Glimpse.Ado you simply need to add a reference to the Glimpse.Ado.dll and Glimpse.Core.dll to your project. There is no need to change your ADO code at all!
